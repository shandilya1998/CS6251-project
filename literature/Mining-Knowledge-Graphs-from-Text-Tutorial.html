<p>Knowledge graphs have become an increasingly crucial component in 
machine intelligence systems, powering ubiquitous digital assistants and
 inspiring several large scale academic projects across the globe. Our 
tutorial explains why knowledge graphs are important, how knowledge 
graphs are constructed, and where new research opportunities exist for 
improving the state-of-the-art. 
In this tutorial, we cover the many sophisticated approaches that 
complete and correct knowledge graphs. We organize this exploration into
 two main classes of models. The first include probabilistic logical 
frameworks that use graphical models, random walks, or statistical rule 
mining to construct knowledge graphs. The second class of models 
includes latent space models such as matrix and tensor factorization and
 neural networks. 
We conclude the tutorial with a critical comparison of techniques and 
results. We will offer practical advice for novices to identify common 
empirical challenges and concrete data sets for initial experimentation.
 Finally, we will highlight promising areas of current and future work.</p>

<!--
The variety and complexity of the available scholarly work, however, makes it difficult for a newcomer to familiarize themselves with the field.
Knowledge graph construction has been decomposed into a large number of inter-dependent and sometimes overlapping tasks, such as the traditional natural language processing, semantic parsing, entity extraction, entity disambiguation and linking, identification and classification of relations, and completion of the knowledge graph.
The kinds of machine learning approaches have also been quite varied, ranging from classification/clustering, probabilistic graphical models, probabilistic logic formulations, matrix/tensor factorization-based approaches, and more recently, deep learning.
There are also a plethora of existing systems that have been proposed, including from top universities such as Stanford (DeepDive), Carnegie Mellon (NELL), University of Washington (OpenIE), Mannheim (DBpedia), and the Max Planck Institut Informatik (YAGO, WebChild) among others.
This diverse and fragmented literature poses a significant roadblock for newcomers to contribute to the field.

We are designing our tutorial to address this barrier.
-->

<p>Our goal is to present an accessible and structured overview of the 
existing approaches to extracting candidate facts from text and 
incorporating these into a well-formed knowledge graph. Our approach 
includes identifying the common themes and challenges in the area, and 
comparing and contrasting the existing approaches on the basis of these 
aspects.
We believe such a unifying framework will provide the necessary tools 
and perspectives to enable the newcomers to the field to explore, 
evaluate, and develop novel techniques for automated knowledge graph 
construction.</p>
