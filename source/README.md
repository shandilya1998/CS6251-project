#Understanding impact of graph structure on word understanding in Neural Network models.

To understand the usefulness of the structural information obtained from dictionary networks, a comparison of word embeddings obtained by making use of the dictionary graph obtained and those from word2vec in a cosine similarity test and a tsne plot test.

##Experiment setting
An autoencoder model that takes into account expanded one-hot representations of words, obtained from the dictionary graph, is used to learn the word embeddings to be compared to word2vec word embeddings.
